# ETHErrorHandling
Here is a guide on the ETH Error Handling project that I made!

# Description
This project is all about the error handling capabilities of Solidity. There are three common functions in error handling: Assert(), Require(), and Revert(). These are used to catch input errors and gate inputs that are not required in the functions.
